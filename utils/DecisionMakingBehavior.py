	- Q_initial: length 3 array containing the initial Q-values set for trial 1
	- chosen_target: length N array of values in range [0,2] which indicate the selected target for the trial. 0 = low-value,
						1 = middle-value, 2 = high-value.
	- rewards: length N array of boolen values indicating whether a reward was given (i.e. = 1) or not (i.e. = 0)
